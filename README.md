#CDBar

This is an addon developed for the World of Warcraft Classic, 2.4.3, and 3.3.5 client.  
Change the content of `/Libs` directory to match your target client.

CDBar scans your spellbook and adds all cooldowns together in a grid of icons. This lets you quickly know when cooldowns are ready again and what cooldowns are ready right now.
This allows you to theoretically hide most of your actionbars assuming they are bound to a keybinding.

####Features:
1. Alt-click on icon to let party/raid know if/when your cooldown is ready
2. Change cooldown order (lower number = earlier in grid)
3. Change icon size and position on screen
4. Remove unwanted cooldowns
5. Dark borders


Type `/cdbar` or `/cdb` to open settings
